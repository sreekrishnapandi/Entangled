    Sliding window example.

    This example shows how to use sliding window encoder and decoder
    stacks. The sliding window is special in that it does not require
    that all symbols are available at the encoder before encoding can
    start. In addition it uses feedback between the decoder and encoder
    such that symbols that have already been received at the decoder
    are not included in the encoding again (saving computations).
