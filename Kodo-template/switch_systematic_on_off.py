    Switch systematic off example.

    This example shows how to enable or disable systematic coding for
    coding stacks that support it.
    Systematic coding is used to reduce the amount of work done by an
    encoder and a decoder. This is achieved by initially sending all
    symbols which has not previously been sent uncoded. Kodo allows this
    feature to be optionally turn of or off.
